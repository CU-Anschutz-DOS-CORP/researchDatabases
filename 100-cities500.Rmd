## Organization
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

## Website
https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/browse?category=500+Cities+%26+Places

## Description
*	This dataset includes model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). 
*	It includes prevalence estimates (crude and age-adjusted) for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. 
*	These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. 
*	Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations
