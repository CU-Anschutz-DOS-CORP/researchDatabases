*	Food Choices—Indicators of the community's access to and acquisition of healthy, affordable food, such as: access and proximity to a grocery store; number of food stores and restaurants; expenditures on fast foods; food and nutrition assistance program participation; food prices; food taxes; and availability of local foods. 
*	Health and Well-Being—Indicators of the community's success in maintaining healthy diets, such as: food insecurity; diabetes and obesity rates; and physical activity levels.

## Collection Methodology
*	In each of the referenced reports, a directory of supermarkets and large grocery stores authorized to accept SNAP benefits was merged with Trade Dimensions' TDLinx directory of stores within the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, for the years 2010 and 2015. 
*	Population data are reported at the block level from the 2010 Census of Population and Housing, while data on income in 2010 are drawn at the block group-level from the 2006-10 American Community Survey, and data on income in 2015 are drawn from the 2010-14 American Community Survey. 
*	These population data were aerially allocated down to ½-kilometer-square grids across the United States. For each ½-kilometer-square grid cell, the distance was calculated from its geographic center to the center of the grid cell with the nearest supermarket. 
*	Rural or urban status is designated by the Census Bureau’s Urban Area definition. Low- income is defined as annual family income of less than or equal to 200 percent of the Federal poverty threshold based on family size.
