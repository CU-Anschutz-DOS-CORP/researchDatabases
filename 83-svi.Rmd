* The CDC SVI ranks each tract into four themes: socioeconomic status, household composition, race/ethnicity/language, and housing/transportation. Also, gives an overall SVI. 
* Each tract receives a separate ranking for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking. Rankings can be US-wide or state-wide.
