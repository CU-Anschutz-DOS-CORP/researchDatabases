## Description
* The Participant Use Data File (PUF) is a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant data file containing cases submitted to the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP®) Data Registry.
* The intended purpose of this file is to provide researchers at participating sites with a data resource they can use to investigate and advance the quality of care delivered to the metabolic and bariatric surgical patient through the analysis of cases captured by MBSAQIP.

## Vintage/Release Frequency
Annual since 2015

## Observational Unit
Patient

## Collection Methodology
* MBSAQIP collects data on over 200 variables including preoperative risk factors, intraoperative variables, and 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgical procedures in both the inpatient and outpatient setting.
* Required data elements are entered via a web-based data collection tool.
* Portions of the data may be automatically populated by a software program that was developed to extract data from the participating hospital’s existing information systems.
* To ensure the data collected are of the highest quality, the MBSAQIP has developed a host of different training mechanisms for the MBSCRs and conducts a data integrity audit of selected participating centers, when warranted.
