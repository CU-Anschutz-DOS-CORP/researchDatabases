*	Estimates of life expectancy at birth—the average number of years a person can expect to live—for most of the census tracts in the United States for the period 2010-2015

## Vintage/Release Frequency
Single time estimated life expectancy at birth for 2010-2015

## Observational Unit
Census tract

## Collection Methodology
*	Deaths occurring in 2010 through 2015 were geocoded using decedents’ residential addresses to identify and code census tracts 
*	Population estimates were produced based on the 2010 decennial census and the 2011– 2015 American Community Survey 5-year survey 
*	A methodology that combined standard demographic techniques and statistical modeling was developed to address challenges posed by small population sizes and small and missing age-specific death counts 
*	Standard, abridged life table methods were adjusted to account for error introduced by population estimates based on sample data
