# Bridged Race Population Estimates

## Organization
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), CDC

## Website
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm

## Description
* Bridged race population estimates.
* Race bridging makes data collected with one set of race categories consistent with data collected using a different set of race categories, allowing for consistent analysis over time.
* The Vintage 2020 bridged-race postcensal population estimates files contain estimates of the resident population of the United States as of April 1, 2010 - July 1, 2020 (based on the 2010 census).
* The estimates on these files are based on Census 2010 and result from bridging the Vintage 2020 postcensal estimates with 31 race groups (the 31 race groups used in Census 2010 in accordance with the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards for the collection of data on race and ethnicity) to the four race categories specified under the 1977 OMB standards (3, 4).

## Vintage/Release Frequency
Annual since 2000

## Observational Unit
County level

## Collection Methodology
*	Data from the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) are used to develop models for bridging 
*	Use demographic and contextual covariate, both person-level and county-level 
*	Probabilities obtained from regression models and applied to Census files to assign multiple-race persons to a single-race category
