The data contains a set of 124 indicators that were developed by consensus and that allow states and territories and large metropolitan areas to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data that are important to public health practice and available for states, territories and large metropolitan areas. Topics groups covered: alcohol; arthritis; asthma; cancer; cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; diabetes; immunization; nutrition, physical activity, and weight status; oral health; tobacco; overarching conditions; and new topic areas that include disability, mental health, older adults, reproductive health, school health, and systems and environmental change.

Major changes to DAWN were instituted during 2003 as the result of a redesign intended to improve the quality and representativeness of DAWN estimates. As a result, comparisons cannot be made between the old DAWN (2002 and prior years) and the redesigned DAWN (2004 and forward). The year 2003 was a period of transition between the old DAWN and the redesigned DAWN. As a result, only interim, half-year estimates were produced for 2003.

Limited access to supermarkets, supercenters, grocery stores, or other sources of healthy and affordable food may make it harder for some Americans to eat a healthy diet.

The criteria for identifying a census tract as low income are from the Department of Treasury’s New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program. Spatial analysis, string matching, and manual review methods were used to merge the SNAP and TDLinx data sets to construct a combined store directory. For vehicle access, tract-level 2010-2014 estimates of the share of housing units without vehicles is multiplied by the 2010 count of housing units to obtain an estimate of the number of households without vehicles. The share of individuals below 200 percent of poverty is multiplied by the 2010 population to obtain an estimate of the number of people with income at or below 200 percent of poverty. These numbers and shares are then allocated down to the ½-kilometer-square grid level. In previous updates, direct estimates of income and vehicle access were used instead of relying on 2010 population counts for estimation. 27.7 Available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research- atlas/download-the-data/ 27.8 User Guide/Data Dictionary https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation/ 27.9 Cost Free for download 27.10 Proposal or Application required?

The objectives are to assemble statistics on food environment indicators to stimulate research on the determinants of food choices and diet quality, and to provide a spatial overview of a community’s ability to access healthy food and its success in doing so. Food Choices—Indicators of the community’s access to and acquisition of healthy, affordable food, such as: access and proximity to a grocery store; number of food stores and restaurants; expenditures on fast foods; food and nutrition assistance program participation; food prices; food taxes; and availability of local foods. Health and Well-Being—Indicators of the community’s success in maintaining healthy diets, such as: food insecurity; diabetes and obesity rates; and physical activity levels.

Population data are reported at the block level from the 2010 Census of Population and Housing, while data on income in 2010 are drawn at the block group-level from the 2006-10 American Community Survey, and data on income in 2015 are drawn from the 2010-14 American Community Survey. These population data were aerially allocated down to ½-kilometer-square grids across the United States. For each ½-kilometer-square grid cell, the distance was calculated from its geographic center to the center of the grid cell with the nearest supermarket. Rural or urban status is designated by the Census Bureau’s Urban Area definition.

OMB determined current metropolitan status by applying population and worker commuting criteria to the results of the 2010 Census and the 2006-10 American Community Survey (ACS). Metro counties are then divided into three categories according to the total population size of the metro area of which they are part: 1 million people or more, 250,000 to 1 million people, and below 250,000. Nonmetro counties are classified along two dimensions. First, they are divided into three urban-size categories (an urban population of 19,999 or more, 2,500 to 20,000, and less than 2,500) based on the total urban population in the county. Second, nonmetro counties in the three urban-size categories are sub- divided by whether or not the county is adjacent to one or more metro areas. A nonmetro county is defined as adjacent if it physically adjoins one or more metro areas, and has at least 2% of its employed labor force commuting to central metro counties. Nonmetro counties that do not meet these criteria are classed as nonadjacent. 76.7 Available at Free for download 76.8 User Guide/Data Dictionary https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/documentation/ 76.9 Cost Free 76.10 Proposal or Application required?

It includes prevalence estimates (crude and age-adjusted) for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations 100.4 Vintage/Release Frequency Annual from 2016 to 2019 100.5 Observational Unit US, City or Census Tract-level 100.6 Collection Methodology Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch.
