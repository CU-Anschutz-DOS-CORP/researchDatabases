## Collection Methodology
*	Sample of civilian, non-institutionalized subjects aged 12 or older 
*	Sampling design changed in 1999 at which time they started using a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia 
*	There are some sampling changes across years (oversampling, weighting of states, etc.) 
*	Each NSDUH respondent since 2002 has been given an incentive payment of $30. 
*	For selected variables, statistical imputation was performed following logical inference to replace missing responses. Variables are labeled “logically assigned” or “imputation- revised”. 
*	To protect the privacy of respondents, all variables that could be used to identify individuals have been encrypted or collapsed in the public use file. To further ensure respondent confidentiality, the data producer used data substitution and deletion of state identifiers and a subsample of records in the creation of the public use file.

## Special Notes
*	NSDUH was called National Household Survey on Drug Abuse up to 2001 
*	NSDUH restricted-use data files are available for online analysis with the R-DAS 
*	In 2002 and 2011 new population data from the 2000 and 2010 decennial Censuses, respectively, became available for use in NSDUH sample weighting procedures. Therefore the data from 2002 and later should not be compared with data collected in 2001 or earlier to assess changes over time. ?
