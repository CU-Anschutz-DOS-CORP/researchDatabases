## Special Notes
*	Appropriate sample weights are available in each year to adjust the un-weighted sample cases for the minority oversamples and year-to-year sample attrition 
*	Sample weights for generating population estimates also available. 
*	There is a mother and a child sampling weight. 
*	Customized weights for longitudinal research can be created online (https://www.nlsinfo.org/weights/nlscya) 
*	Beginning in 2002, a new algorithm was used to create weights; there are revised weights for prior years using this same algorithm. 
*	A child identification code (CPUBID, C00001.00) allows to link children with their siblings in NLSYCY and with their mother in NLSY79. 
*	The panel dimension of the NLSY79 data collection permits one to cumulate sample cases for children at specified ages across survey points but this limits the ability to follow a particular age cohort across survey years. ?
