    *	Meteorological data, descriptive information about each monitoring station, data quality assurance and quality control information 
*	The most commonly requested aggregation levels of data (and key metrics) are: 
    *	Sample values as standard units (e.g. 1-hour or 24-hour averages) 
    *	NAAQS average values (8-hour for ozone and CO, 24-hour for PM2.5) 
    *	Daily summary values (e.g. observation count, percent, mean, max and time of max, air quality index, number of observations greater than standard) 
    *	Annual summary values (e.g. observation count and percent, valid days, required/null/exceptional observation counts, mean and standard deviation, maximum observations, percentiles, number of observations greater than standard) 
    *	Site and monitor information (FIPS state code, FIPS county code, site number, parameter code, parameter occurrence code, latitude, longitude, measurement method information, owner/operator/data submitter, monitoring network, exemptions from regulatory requirements, operational dates, city and CBSA 
    *	Quality assurance information (for 19 possible QA assessments)
