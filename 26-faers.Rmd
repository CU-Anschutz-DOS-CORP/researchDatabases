* If a manufacturer receives a report from a healthcare professional or consumer, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.

## Special Notes
* There is no certainty that the reported event (adverse event or medication error) was due to the product. FDA does not require that a causal relationship between a product and event be proven, and reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event. 
* FDA does not receive reports for every adverse event or medication error that occurs with a product. 
* There are also duplicate reports where the same report was submitted by a consumer and by the sponsor. 
* FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the U.S. population.
