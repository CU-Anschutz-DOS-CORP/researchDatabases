## Description
* The National Beneficiary Survey (NBS), sponsored by our Office of Retirement and Disability Policy, provides SSA, Congress, other policymakers, and researchers with information about key health, employment, and socio-demographic factors that contribute to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries’ and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients’ successful or unsuccessful employment efforts.
* The NBS collects data on a wide range of variables not available in the agency’s administrative systems, including socio-demographic information, health and functional status, health insurance, interest in work, barriers to work, use of services, employment, income, and experience with Social Security programs.
